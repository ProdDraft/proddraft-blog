I've been using Claude Code daily for a month. Not for side projects. Not for tutorials. For real shipping — building features for ProdDraft, debugging production issues, refactoring a codebase I've been maintaining since before AI coding tools existed.

Here's what 30 days of letting an AI agent touch production code actually looks like.

## What Claude Code is

Claude Code is Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent. It's not an editor. It's not an autocomplete. It's a developer that reads your codebase, understands your problem, proposes changes, and implements them — all from the terminal.

The workflow: you describe what you want, Claude explores your codebase, asks clarifying questions, writes the code, runs tests, and iterates until it works. You review the diff and approve. That's it.

It costs $200/month for the Max plan (unlimited usage). The Pro plan at $20/month has usage caps that a daily coder will hit in about 3 days.

## Week 1: the honeymoon

My first task was refactoring a FastAPI codebase — moving from synchronous SQLAlchemy to async, restructuring the project layout, and adding proper error handling. The kind of task that would take me 3-4 hours of focused work.

Claude Code did it in 45 minutes.

Not because the AI is smarter. Because it doesn't get distracted. It reads every file, understands the dependency graph, makes a plan, and executes it. No checking Slack. No wondering if the approach is right. Just reading and writing code until it's done.

The first week, I threw everything at it: build a new API endpoint, add rate limiting, set up CI pipelines, write documentation. Every task completed. Every test passed. I started to wonder if I even needed to code anymore.

## Week 2: the reality

Then I asked it to add a feature that required understanding business logic spread across 8 files — some of which were undocumented decisions I'd made at 11pm six months ago.

Claude spent 20 minutes exploring the codebase, asked 3 clarifying questions, and produced a PR. The code was clean, well-structured, and completely wrong. It had misunderstood a subtle business rule that was documented in a comment in one file and implied by a variable name in another.

The lesson: Claude Code is excellent at understanding code. It's mediocre at understanding intent. If the intent is clearly documented, it nails it. If the intent is in your head or scattered across implicit patterns, it guesses. Sometimes the guess is right. Sometimes it's not.

This is the real cost of AI coding agents. Not the $200/month — the time spent reviewing code that looks right but has subtle logic errors. The review burden shifts from "did they implement this correctly?" to "does this implementation match what I actually meant?"

## Week 3: finding the sweet spot

I changed my workflow. Instead of giving Claude vague feature requests, I started writing micro-specs: 3-5 sentences describing exactly what the feature does, what the edge cases are, and what the tests should cover.

The difference was immediate. Accuracy went from ~70% to ~95%. The time I spent writing micro-specs was less than the time I'd been spending fixing misunderstood implementations.

The sweet spot for Claude Code is:

1. **Write a micro-spec** (3-5 sentences)
2. **Let Claude explore** the codebase and ask questions
3. **Review the plan** before any code is written
4. **Let Claude implement** with tests
5. **Review the diff** — focus on business logic, not syntax

This workflow feels like pair programming with a very fast junior developer who never gets tired but occasionally hallucinates a library method that doesn't exist.

## Week 4: what it can't do

By week 4, I had a clear picture of what Claude Code excels at and where it falls short.

**What it's great at:**
- Refactoring (structural changes across many files)
- Greenfield features (clear specs, no legacy constraints)
- Test writing (generating comprehensive test suites)
- Documentation (generating READMEs, API docs, comments)
- Boilerplate (CRUD endpoints, form validation, config files)

**What it's mediocre at:**
- Debugging subtle logic errors (it can find the bug location but often proposes wrong fixes)
- Performance optimization (tends toward readability over speed)
- Understanding implicit business rules (you need micro-specs for this)
- Working with poorly documented legacy code (joins you in the confusion)

**What it can't do:**
- Architecture decisions (it can propose options but can't weigh tradeoffs)
- Security review (it can find obvious issues but misses subtle ones)
- Know when to stop (will keep optimizing a solved problem unless you tell it to ship)

## The cost equation

At $200/month for Max, Claude Code needs to save you roughly 2 hours of work to break even at a developer's effective hourly rate. It saved me about 15 hours in the first week alone. The math is easy.

But the real cost isn't the subscription — it's the context switching tax. Every time you switch from "writing code" to "reviewing AI-generated code," there's a mental gear shift. You're reading, not creating. Verifying, not building. After 4 hours of reviewing Claude's output, I'm more mentally drained than after 8 hours of writing code myself.

I've settled into a pattern: Claude Code for the morning sprint (generate features, write tests, refactor), manual coding for the afternoon (review diffs, fix edge cases, make architecture decisions). The combination is more productive than either alone.

## Should you use it?

If you're a solo developer shipping products, Claude Code is worth the $200/month. It's the most capable coding agent I've used, and the gap between it and the next-best option (Cursor's agent mode) is real.

If you're on a team, the value depends on your review culture. If your team already does thorough code reviews, Claude Code fits in naturally — it's just another contributor whose PRs need review. If your team merges first and asks questions later, adding an AI agent to the mix is dangerous.

If you're learning to code, do not use Claude Code. It will write code you don't understand, and you'll build things without knowing how they work. Cursor or Copilot are better for learning — they assist rather than replace.

I'm keeping my Max subscription. The month taught me that AI coding agents aren't replacing developers — they're making the best developers dramatically more productive while making it easier than ever to ship bad code fast. Which one you become depends on how well you review.
